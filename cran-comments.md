## Package purpose

This package provides tools for accessing and analyzing Canadian Election Study (CES) datasets. The CES has been conducted during federal elections since 1965, providing valuable data for political science research.

The package handles downloading data files from the Borealis Data repository, converts them to appropriate R formats, and provides utilities for subsetting and analyzing the data.

## CRAN-specific notes

* All data downloads require internet access and are properly wrapped in \dontrun{} to avoid issues during CRAN checks
* All functions provide appropriate error handling for network issues
* The package respects user file systems and always asks for confirmation before overwriting files
* Functions that download data provide clear messages about what is happening
* All documentation examples use a consistent style and properly demonstrate function usage
